# alphafold_shortcourse

AlphaFold2 is an open-source artificial intelligence program that predicts the 3D structure of proteins based on their amino acid sequence. The program and its underlying algorithm solve a long-standing problem in structural biology, so adoption by the research community has been swift and enthusiastic.

Running AlphaFold2 involves a simple input file and few parameter specifications, but requires access to large-scale computational resources such as GPUs and enough RAM to perform a search against a collection of datasets exceeding 2 TB. This RC Short Course* will provide an overview of running AlphaFold2 on CU Boulderâ€™s Alpine supercomputer, covering performance considerations and limitations, predicting monomer and multimer proteins, checking AlphaFold2 outputs, and how to take advantage of spin-offs like ParaFold.

Participants should have a Research Computing Account prior to the start of the training if they wish to try hands-on examples. RMACC members should refer to our RMACC Access to Alpine page.

* What is an RC Short Course? A training that provides an in-depth understanding of a concept, system, or tool. You can expect to leave a "Short Course" with a solid grasp of the topic
